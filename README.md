###### Adjustable silence trimmer for .wav files
## Prerequisites
1. Install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
## Usage
1. Run `main.py` to start program. 
2. Click **Open file** button and select a file to trim.
Program should plot the sound wave, so you can see where the silence is. 
You can use a toolbar to see the plot precisely. 
3. Enter a max level of silence, which is percentage of your sound file amplitude. 
4. **Confirm value** and **Plot silence** to make sure you chose the right value. 
5. If this choice doesn't satisfy you, **Plot source wave** and go back to 3. 
6. If plot is right, click **Cut silence** button, and you will get a trimmed sound wave. 
7. **Save file** to desired directory.
8. **Open file** again or **Exit**.
